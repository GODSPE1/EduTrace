Project Overview:EduTrace is a modern learning roadmap platform designed for students, educators, and lifelong learners. It provides structured, interactive roadmaps for a wide range of subjects (e.g., Microbiology, Data Science, Computer Science, Physics, etc.), allowing users to learn through topic-based lessons, take quizzes, track progress, and earn certificates or badges as proof of achievement. Your primary goal is to build an interactive learning experience web app. Users browse courses, follow roadmaps, complete topic-based lessons, take quizzes, and earn certificates or badges as proof of achievement.

Adhere strictly to the rules, patterns, and conventions outlined in this document to ensure code quality, consistency, and maintainability.

Technology Stack
The project uses the following technologies. Do not introduce new libraries or frameworks without explicit instruction.

Language: TypeScript
Main Framework: Next.js (App Router)
Database & Auth: Supabase
Styling: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
State Management: Primarily Server Components for server state. Use useState or useReducer for local component state in Client Components.
API Communication: Use Next.js Server Actions for mutations (creating polls, voting). Fetch data in Server Components using the Supabase client.
Utility Libraries: A library like qrcode.react for generating QR codes.
Architecture & Code Style
Directory Structure: Follow the standard Next.js App Router structure.

/app for routes and pages.
/components/ui for shadcn/ui components.
/components/ for custom, reusable components.
/lib for Supabase client setup, utility functions, and Server Actions.
Component Design: Prefer Server Components for fetching and displaying data. Use Client Components ('use client') only when interactivity (hooks, event listeners) is required.

Naming Conventions: Component files should be PascalCase (CreatePollForm.tsx). Utility and action functions should be camelCase (submitVote.ts).

Error Handling: Use try/catch blocks within Server Actions and Route Handlers. Use Next.js error.tsx files for handling errors within route segments.

API Keys & Secrets: Never hardcode secrets. Use environment variables (.env.local) for Supabase URL and keys, accessed via process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and process.env.SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY.

Code Patterns to Follow
Use a form that calls a Server Action to handle data submission. This keeps client-side JavaScript minimal.
Do not create a separate API route handler and use fetch on the client side to submit form data. Use Server Actions instead.
Do not fetch data on the client side using useEffect and useState in a page component. Fetch data directly in a Server Component.
Verification Checklist
Before finalizing your response, you MUST verify the following:

Does the code use the Next.js App Router and Server Components for data fetching?
Are Server Actions used for data mutations (forms)?
Is the Supabase client used for all database interactions?
Are shadcn/ui components used for the UI where appropriate?
Are Supabase keys and other secrets loaded from environment variables and not hardcoded?
