## ðŸ”’ Security Improvements

### Authentication Cookie Handling Fix
- **Issue**: Auth callback route had empty cookie set/remove stubs preventing proper session management
- **Fix**: Implemented proper cookie handling with collection arrays and response application
- **Technical Details**:
  ```typescript
  // Collect operations during auth exchange
  const cookiesToSet: Array<{name: string, value: string, options: any}> = []
  const cookiesToRemove: Array<{name: string, options?: any}> = []
  
  // Apply to response after successful auth
  cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) => {
    response.cookies.set(name, value, options)
  })
  cookiesToRemove.forEach(({ name }) => {
    response.cookies.delete(name)
  })
  ```
- **Impact**: Authentication sessions now properly persist after OAuth callback

### Profile Access Control Enhancement
- **Issue**: Overly permissive profile visibility allowing all users (including anonymous) to view all profiles
- **Fix**: Restricted profile viewing to authenticated users only
- **Policy Change**: 
  ```sql
  -- Before (vulnerable)
  CREATE POLICY "Users can view all profiles" ON public.profiles FOR SELECT USING (true);
  
  -- After (secure)
  CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view profiles" ON public.profiles FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
  ```
- **Business Logic Alignment**: This aligns with the app model where roadmaps are publicly viewable but user tracking features require authentication

### âœ… Zod Dependency Fix Complete

**Changes Made:**
- Updated Zod version in `package.json` from `^4.1.11` (non-existent) to `^3.23.8` (latest stable)
- Installed dependencies successfully with `npm install`
- Fixed TypeScript errors discovered during the process:
  - Removed duplicate code in `database.ts`
  - Fixed syntax errors in `middleware.ts` (duplicate Supabase client creation)
  - Fixed missing cookie methods in `supabase.ts`

**Verification Results:**
- âœ… TypeScript compilation: No errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- âœ… Dependency compatibility: Zod v3.23.8 works perfectly with:
  - `@hookform/resolvers@5.2.2`
  - `react-hook-form@7.63.0`
- âœ… Application startup: Next.js dev server runs without issues
- âœ… Package lockfile: Updated correctly with the new Zod version

**Technical Notes:**
- Zod v4.1.11 doesn't exist on the public npm registry
- Zod v3.23.8 is the latest stable version and is fully compatible with your current React Hook Form setup
- No existing code was using Zod, so the version change is completely safe
- The application builds and runs successfully with the new version

**Summary:**  
The dependency issue has been resolved and all compatibility checks have passed. Your project is now using a valid, stable version of Zod that works seamlessly with your form handling libraries.
