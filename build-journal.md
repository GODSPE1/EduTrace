## Security Enhancement Complete ✅

**Date**: September 22, 2025  
**Latest Update**: Fixed profile visibility security vulnerability

---

## 🔒 Security Improvements

### Authentication Cookie Handling Fix
- **Issue**: Auth callback route had empty cookie set/remove stubs preventing proper session management
- **Fix**: Implemented proper cookie handling with collection arrays and response application
- **Technical Details**:
  ```typescript
  // Collect operations during auth exchange
  const cookiesToSet: Array<{name: string, value: string, options: any}> = []
  const cookiesToRemove: Array<{name: string, options?: any}> = []
  
  // Apply to response after successful auth
  cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) => {
    response.cookies.set(name, value, options)
  })
  cookiesToRemove.forEach(({ name }) => {
    response.cookies.delete(name)
  })
  ```
- **Impact**: Authentication sessions now properly persist after OAuth callback

### Profile Access Control Enhancement
- **Issue**: Overly permissive profile visibility allowing all users (including anonymous) to view all profiles
- **Fix**: Restricted profile viewing to authenticated users only
- **Policy Change**: 
  ```sql
  -- Before (vulnerable)
  CREATE POLICY "Users can view all profiles" ON public.profiles FOR SELECT USING (true);
  
  -- After (secure)
  CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view profiles" ON public.profiles FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
  ```
- **Business Logic Alignment**: This aligns with the app model where roadmaps are publicly viewable but user tracking features require authentication

✅ Zod Dependency Fix Complete
Changes Made:
Updated Zod version in package.json from ^4.1.11 (non-existent) to ^3.23.8 (latest stable)
Installed dependencies successfully with npm install
Fixed TypeScript errors that were discovered during the process:
Removed duplicate code in database.ts
Fixed syntax errors in middleware.ts (duplicate Supabase client creation)
Fixed missing cookie methods in supabase.ts
Verification Results:
✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors (npx tsc --noEmit)
✅ Dependency compatibility: Zod v3.23.8 works perfectly with:
@hookform/resolvers@5.2.2
react-hook-form@7.63.0
✅ Application startup: Next.js dev server runs without issues
✅ Package lockfile: Updated correctly with the new Zod version
Technical Notes:
Zod v4.1.11 doesn't exist on the public npm registry
Zod v3.23.8 is the latest stable version and is fully compatible with your current React Hook Form setup
No existing code was using Zod, so the version change is completely safe
The application builds and runs successfully with the new version
The dependency issue has been resolved and all compatibility checks have passed. Your project is now using a valid, stable version of Zod that works seamlessly with your form handling libraries
