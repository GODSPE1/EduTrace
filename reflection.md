*This reflection represents one month of intensive AI-assisted development, documenting both successes and challenges in building a production-ready learning management system.*

The design and architecture of the app were clarified early during brainstorming. AI helped me outline the user flow, which made moving into system design easier. At that stage, I focused on choosing the best architecture and preparing for scalability as the number of users might grow. Brainstorming with AI felt almost like working alongside a senior developer guiding me through each step.

A project tree structure was then created, and I manually initiated the app setup, accounting for dependencies and the tech stack (Tailwind, TypeScript, and others). With AI‚Äôs support, the scaffolding of the app was built based on the tree structure, and key files like the homepage were generated. On the database side, Supabase was created manually on the platform and then configured with the app. later using itrative action the final tree structure was generated 

sample fo project tree structure 
`
code stucture
    /app
  /layout.tsx          # Global layout (navbar, footer)
  /page.tsx            # Homepage (list of courses)

  /course/[courseId]/page.tsx       # Course detail with roadmaps
  /roadmap/[roadmapId]/page.tsx     # Roadmap detail with topics
  /topic/[topicId]/page.tsx         # Topic detail + quiz
  /exam/[roadmapId]/page.tsx        # Roadmap exam
  /dashboard/page.tsx               # User progress + certificates

  /auth
    /login/page.tsx
    /register/page.tsx

/api
  /certificates/route.ts            # API route to generate certificate PDF
  /quiz/submit/route.ts             # Handle quiz submissions
`


The most iterative and enjoyable part was using AI (CodeRabbit) for code reviews. This was truly mind-blowing. AI provided valuable feedback on security concerns (like XSS attacks) and suggested corrections, which significantly improved my code quality.

To track my learning, I maintained a dedicated file where I documented prompts, AI solutions, and the reasoning behind them. This allowed me to compare my own problem-solving approaches with AI‚Äôs iterative methods‚Äîa very powerful way to learn.

Of course, there were some limitations. The faster AI generated output, the more careful review was required to ensure accuracy and quality. One particular challenge was using AI for committing code and writing commit messages. This backfired because a single commit message ended up being used for multiple implementations, which made tracking changes difficult.




Key Learnings

AI is powerful for brainstorming, scaffolding, and reviewing code.

The iterative prompting and reviewing cycle helped me improve my thinking process.

However, AI output requires careful human oversight to avoid mistakes.

Documentation of prompts and iterations is an excellent way to turn AI into a learning partner, not just a coding assistant.

Overall, this experience taught me that AI is not just a coding shortcut but a true collaborator‚Äîif used thoughtfully and with proper checks in place.
